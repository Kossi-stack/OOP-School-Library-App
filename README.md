# OOP-School-Library-App

Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that I created will allow you to:

    Add new students or teachers.
    Add new books.
    Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

Built With

    Ruby
